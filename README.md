Swift6502
=========

Toy implementation of a 6502 emulator in Swift.

In order to test emulation completeness, I've "stolen" the test suite from the *excellent* [py65](https://github.com/mnaberez/py65) project.

Next steps
----------

Try to get from a 'toy' phase to a somewhat decent project.

In no particular order:

- write a proper test runner
- change the structure of the project to conform to the Swift package manager
- documentation
- write a monitor
- write a simple assembler / disassembler
- resume work on the "Console 64" example
